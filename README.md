# split-combine
Tool to split and then combine outputs

There are two ways to use this program:

# using split-combine directly
Just type `split-combine [-s|-c] file1 file2 [file3...]`
In split mode, the source is taken from stdin.

In combine mode, the output is sent to stdout.

# using the sc script
You will need to modify this script to fit your environment. I made this to make my usage
of split-combine over a LAN easier.
